hi,

got an opportunity for your site to engage your visitors and generate additional income. How? I recently created an unique game for car enthusiasts. The latest feature is ability to embed our game to any website, engage users and share revenue from their in-game payments. We give you up to 20% of every payment. All this for 100% free of course and super easy to implement, can be done in less than 15 minutes. Details to find on www.car-battle.com/partner.html.

Even if that doesnâ€™t works for you, please let me know as your feedback is appreciated.

greetings and have a good day,
Marek
